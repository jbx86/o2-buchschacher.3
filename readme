Operating Systems Assignment 3

Running oss will allocate shared memory, initialize a shared system clock, allocate a
messaging queue, and execute child processes according to the arguments passed to it.

These child processes are executions of user which will wait for a message, then generat
a random duration and execute for that length of simulated system time. After running to
completion the user process will message the oss that it is terminating.

Oss will then increment simulated system time by its own
increment then fork off another instance of user. oss will repeat this process until it
detects that 2 minutes of real time have passed, 100 user processes have executed, or the
simulated system clock has reached 2 seconds.

Usage:
./oss [options]

Options:
-h              Display this dialog
-s x            Set max number of child processes running at one time to x (default 5)
-l filename     Use filename as log file
-t z            Set master to terminate itself after z seconds (default 20)
